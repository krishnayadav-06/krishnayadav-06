## Hey there! 👋

I'm **Kris**, a student and engineer.

I (Re)-desgin what I despise and try and build stuff that I need.

If something feels inefficient or poorly designed,  
I’ll try and make it work better.

Figma is what I primarily use to desgin,

Right now, I’m focused on getting really good at  
**Data Structures & Algorithms**
